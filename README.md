- OpenAI GPT counseling module with local rule-based fallback
- Dashboard with Chart.js visualizations
- Downloadable professional PDF counseling report
- Search and filters for city, branch, accreditation label, hostel, fees, and placement fields

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.12+
- Flask
- SQLite
- Bootstrap 5
- Chart.js
- OpenAI API
- ReportLab

## Setup

```bash
cd AI-College-Recommendation
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
python app.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## OpenAI Configuration

The application works without an API key using the rule-based counseling fallback.

To enable GPT counseling, add an API key to `.env`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

## Dataset

The main dataset is stored at `database/colleges.csv`. It was generated from the official CET institute-wise allotment page:

`https://fe2025.mahacet.org/StaticPages/frmInstituteWiseAllotmentList?did=2021`

Included cities:

- Nagpur
- Amravati
- Pune
- Mumbai
- Nashik

The generated dataset contains 140 institutes and 3,135 official CAP-IV closing-score rows by institute, branch, and mapped category.

Columns include:

- College Name
- City
- State
- Branch
- Category
- Closing Percentile / closing score
- Fees
- Placement Percentage
- Average Package
- Highest Package
- Hostel
- NAAC Grade
- NBA
- Website
- Admission Process

`database/cutoffs.csv` provides a compact official closing-score export, `database/institutes.csv` stores the filtered official institute list, and `database/scholarships.csv` powers scholarship matching.

The official CET allotment page does not publish institute fees, hostel, placement, NAAC, or NBA values. Those fields are kept in the CSV for app compatibility and display as “Not provided” in the UI/PDF when unavailable.

## Recommendation Logic

The engine filters by category, branch, city, percentile, and hostel preference. It then ranks colleges using:

- Admission probability
- Official closing score
- Lower fees

Admission chance examples:

- Student percentile 96, cutoff 95: High or Very High
- Student percentile 92, cutoff 94: Medium
- Student percentile 88, cutoff 95: Low

## Deployment

For Render or Railway, set:

```bash
gunicorn app:app
```

Recommended environment variables:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=strong-random-secret
OPENAI_API_KEY=optional
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

## Disclaimer

This application uses official CET CAP-IV allotment data for the included city filter, but students must still verify final official cutoff lists, seat matrix, fees, accreditation, institute approvals, and admission notices before making final decisions.
